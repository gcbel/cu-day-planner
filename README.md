# Task Tracker

## Description

Visit this site at https://gcbel.github.io/cu-task-tracker/.

For this project, I created a website that allows users to create and store a list of tasks, along with their due date and description. The task list persists between page visits. The page locally stores a user's task list, including task titles, descriptions, and due dates. Through this project, I had the opportunity to practice using Jquery.

The final deployed desktop webpage:

This project is based on this reference provided by the Columbia University Full-Stack Bootcamp.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Webpage can be viewed in any browser. The page allows users to input a title, due date, and description for each post. Tasks can be dragged between page divisions, allowing users to track progress on each task. Tasks can also be deleted.

When due dates approach, the task card changes color from white to yellow, and past due cards turn red.
